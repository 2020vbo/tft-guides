Playing a contested line almost always lowers your average placement and makes your board noticeably more expensive to hit. This means your chances of reaching higher levels and fully capping out your board are significantly lower, and you'll have to pay special attention to properly managing your econ. In order to reach greater consistency, it's important to understand when to pivot and when to remain on the contested line.
### If you're contested on a reroll line
Playing reroll contested is very miserable and you should very actively avoid doing so if at all possible. If your spot is better, try to convince your contester to play something else. If the comp is a 1 or 2 cost reroll comp and they refuse to pivot, compare your spots. Pay extra attention to your econ, as that will be the key factor on whether or not you can hit. If you are confident in your spot and think you can hit first, you can stay on the line and contest them. Otherwise, you should either pivot or use your spot for tempo and push levels. If the comp is a 3 cost reroll comp and they refuse to pivot, it's probably not worth the risk, but if you have balls of steel then you can still go for it I guess. Just know that there is a decent chance you will end up going 8th.

### If you're contested on a standard level 8 line
Most level 8 comps can support 2 players, but you will find that, on average, the gold required to hit does increase noticeably. If there is another comp that you can play from your spot that is comparable in strength, or at least another variation of the comp, you may choose to play that instead for the sake of consistency. This doesn't mean you have to close off your original gameplan, but you should stay open to other possibilities and hold secondary units that could serve as a backup. If there are 2 or more players contesting your line, you should probably look to play something else entirely unless your econ is extremely strong.

### When playing contested
Combat augments will obviously make your board stronger than an econ augment, but that's assuming that we are able to reach the same board in both scenarios. This is often not the case when contested, so if you are committing to a line where you are contested, you should probably look to take an econ augment, especially on stage 2. The extra gold could allow you to reach the desired level first and roll before your contester has a chance to spend their own gold, giving you access to a larger pool on your rolls.
