Playing flexibly, or "flex play," is a bit of a vague term and has become somewhat of a buzzword. Many players would argue that flex play, as it was classically known, is more or less dead. Personally, while I think this opinion is a bit dramatic, it is certainly true that recent sets have offered less room for flexible play. This is a function in part due to set design and balance, but can also be partially attributed to the average player's increased understanding of the game. Another common opinion is that playing flex in recent sets does not reward the player proportionally to the effort it requires, as it relies on your game knowledge and understanding of board strength rather than blindly copying known guides and comps—you'll often find yourself carefully weighing your options to fight for a 4th or 3rd place finish. That being said, understanding the mechanics behind flex play can enable you to take advantage on important opportunities when they present themselves and will allow you to confidently pilot unconventional lines without compromising the cap to your board. Flex play is, in my opinion, the highest form of skill expression in TFT and will allow you to consistently find an edge against lower-ranked players to accelerate your climb.

## What is *NOT* Flex Play?
Now, that's all well and good, but what exactly is flex play? Let's start by looking at what flex play is *not*:
- Playing lots of comps:
	- Having a wide variety of comps in your match history is not necessarily an indication of flexible play. Flexibility is not about the final state of your board, it's about the evolution of your board over the game and the rigidity of the units.
- Playing wide:
	- Playing wide means to play towards multiple outs. For example, Having slammed an Infinity Edge and a Giant Slayer I am happy to play either Star Guardians Jinx or Soul Fighter Samira, or even Caitlyn Reroll. This is not flexible play despite having a choice between several distinct comps. I have options, but each option is more or less an exact set of 8 units.
- Not slamming any items until after your rolldown:
	- lol

## Flex Play is Not a Binary
The first thing to note is that flexible play exists on a spectrum. If 100% true flex is on one end of the spectrum, perhaps being fully committed on 1-4 is the other end.
