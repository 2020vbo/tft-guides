Each player in a given TFT lobby will receive the same number of components dropped from neutrals. This means that if you put yourself in a position where you are forced to slam items that don't contribute to the power of your board, you'll effectively be missing items compared to other players. To avoid this, we need to think about our item economy.

Item economy may refer to one of two concepts:
1) Crafting items that maximize the value of each component given
2) Managing which components are left available to you.

The goal of #2 is essentially to make #1 as easy/likely as possible, but it's enough of an intermediary step that it is worth thinking about explicitly rather than solely as a means to #1. In fact, you should generally be thinking about #2 over #1 most of the time, and only be actively prioritizing #1 over #2 in stage 4 when you will be receiving your final components. This isn't to say that the two concepts are at odds—far from it—but thinking about #1 early on in the game doesn't tend to give you as much actionable direction because there is still so much potential for variance.

Essentially, concept 2 is interested in reducing variance by making future items easier to deal with, whereas concept 1 is interested in making the most of the components you already have, and it is possible to accomplish both at the same time (i.e. making good item slams that also leave flexible components open).

Concept 2 can also be further broken down into 2 ideas:
1) Leaving "favored components" open—they'll be useful later no matter what
2) Leaving components that can resolve "problematic components" open—you can make useless items useful

Learning to properly manage your item economy is incredibly important because it's the resource we have the least control over; your only guaranteed chances to handpick components are on carousels stages 2-4, with reduced options based on HP, and the anvil drop on the stage 4 neutral round. With enough gold, we can usually hit whatever units we want, but no amount of gold will change the components we are given. This is also why items should generally be prioritized over units on the carousel (with some exceptions).

## Volibear/Samira Example
As of patch 15.2c (already patched out of the metagame, but the concepts remain the same!), one of the strongest comps is 4 Luchador Volibear. Here's an example of what your board may look like on level 8.

There are a couple of variations, but this is generally accepted as the ideal version of the comp at the moment. This more or less features the ideal items on the 2 carries as well. For illustrative purposes, let's say we consider Volibear's items non-negotiable and want to hard-prio giving him those exact 3 items. That alone would require **3 swords, 2 gloves, and a belt**. Samira ideally wanting another 2 swords and gloves *on top of that* would create a very high demand for those two components, and we see that in the space of offensive components (sword, glove, rod, bow, tear), we have a *severe* lack of ways to use bows and rods (more on tears later, they're a bit special). This means if we are to receive any bows/rods while angling for this exact board, we need to immediately find ways to use rods and bows so that they're not sitting on our bench taking up dead space. This can be done by determining what items would provide *some* value using those components and making sure to leave those recipes available. Below are all of the items craftable from rod and bow:

![[Pasted image 20250819170722.png]]
### Bow
For bow, we have a few decent options to cope with, namely **Red Buff**, **Giant Slayer**, **Last Whisper**, and **Kraken's Fury**. Giant Slayer and Last Whisper are less ideal because they use our most desired components (sword and glove), but Giant Slayer can serve as a third item if we are short on swords or if we just want a generic damage item (yes, I know I said Voli items are non-negotiable in this example, but you're simply not gonna get this many swords every single game). Kraken is also fairly good in the stats for Voli since his cast gives him attack speed, but I prefer up-front damage over scaling for him. Red buff is particularly good because Samira's cast deals AoE damage, making her good at applying the burn, and it takes care of TWO bows, creating an easy solution if we are dropped too many.
### Rod
For rod, the only items we could even consider are **Crownguard** and **Morellonomicon**. Crownguard is an acceptably fine tank item crafted from a chain, which isn't usually a component we care about greeding on. Morellonomicon is much less ideal since we are using a pretty desirable component in the belt. Belt makes Striker's Flail as well as great Sett items like Warmog's and Spirit Visage. To sacrifice one of those to make an inferior (IN THIS COMP) version of Red Buff isn't great, but it's undeniable that we are still getting value from it due to the raw utility of the burn effect, even if the stats aren't great. **Guinsoo's Rageblade** may be tempting, since it uses one of each component, but in this comp that item does almost nothing. Neither carry makes very good use of it in the first place, and on top of that, this comp doesn't really specialize in drawing out fights for the Rageblade to scale.

From this analysis, we can see that even out of the problematic offensive components, rods are *significantly* more likely to cause issues with our itemization, and finding ways to reduce the impact of receiving rods would greatly improve our consistency with this comp. Let's see how we can put that into practice.
### Using Item Economy to Inform Slams
Imagine a scenario while playing for this line where we have a **belt**, **cloak**, and **chain** as our components, which gives us three options for craftable items: **Sunfire Cape**, **Evenshroud**, and **Gargoyle's Stoneplate**. If you wanted to slam an item immediately, which one would you prioritize here?

Personally, my order would be Evenshroud > Gargoyle's Stoneplate > Sunfire Cape.
### Evenshroud Slam:
- Leftover component: chain
	- Rod + Chain = **Crownguard (!!)**  -> turns useless rod into another frontline item
	- Bow + Chain = Titan's -> normally would be a good bruiser item but not very good for Voli, since he already gets CC immunity from his cast
- Offensive frontline item with decent defensive stats (bonus resists at combat start)
- Provides utility in the form of passive AoE Sunder
- **TLDR; Good utility from the item itself + handles excess rods well**

### Gargoyle's Slam:
- Leftover component: belt
	- Rod + Belt = **Morellonomicon** -> not great but could be worse, at least it has utility
	- Bow + Belt = Nashor's Tooth -> very very useless ngl
	- Open belt can be Warmog's/Striker's/Visage
- Defensive item best for solo-frontlining mixed damage
	- Kind of a mid item late-game; too much damage for solo-frontlining to be effective in most comps (it's fine if you just need some generic frontline value though)
- **TLDR; Decent frontline item, can handle rod if you cope, bow not so much but bow also not as problematic. Helps your item economy in other ways unrelated to bows/rods.**

### Sunfire Slam:
- Leftover component: cloak
	- Rod + Cloak = Ionic Spark -> literally useless (MR shred) lmao
	- Bow + Cloak = **Kraken's Fury** -> can make (stats aren't bad) but, again, I prefer up-front stats in this comp personally (this is likely no longer true after the nerfs btw—up front stats are now less valuable on Voli).
- Offensive frontline item with meh stats and meh utility
	- Passive burn application, frontline is not that juiced
- ***Reduces*** the value of slamming **Red Buff** (2 sources of burn), making excess bows more difficult to play around.
- **TLDR; Open cloak kinda whatever and Sunfire slam only exacerbates the issues with bows. In exchange we get a very mid utility item. Yay.**

## Generalizing Item Economy Analysis
While this process may seem daunting, it gives you an explicit framework by which to manage item components and limit variance for a given comp. You can essentially repeat this exact process for any comp and thereby understand what components you should keep and which ones to get rid of as soon as possible.
### Step 1: Favored Components
Identify which components require many copies. In most cases, we only really need to worry about the offensive components (sword, bow, glove, rod, tear), since tank items are more situational on the lobby and usually won't ruin your game. In the Volibear example, we needed a lot of swords, but some comps want lots of tears or gloves or whatever, so take a look at the ideal items for your carry (or carries) beforehand. In this step, we shouldn't consider *only* the Best-in-Slot (BiS) items. You won't find BiS every game and will sometimes have to find compromises. On many units (usually melee), BiS is also not super clear-cut. Identifying secondary item options will help you make back-up plans or help you when you are later picks in the carousel.
### Step 2: Problematic Components
Finding good secondary item options also helps us narrow down which components are truly useless. We found that rods were terrible for the Volibear comp because none of the options craftable from rod were even remotely useful for our carries. However, we also need to consider items that are necessary but may cause issues in excess. For example, many AP comps ideally want a Shojin to generate mana with, which requires a sword, but struggle to use additional copies of swords beyond the first or second. This means that while BiS may include a sword, it can be risky to pick swords from carousel, although it may still sometimes be the correct play.

For each problematic component, determine what options we have to still get use out of them. In Voli's case, this meant leaving chain available for excess rods. In the case of extra swords for AP comps, we can use them to craft Giant Slayer or Hextech Gunblade. Bows can be turned into utility items like Red Buff, Last Whisper, or Void Staff if they aren't suitable for our main carry, but excessive copies can potentially cause issues if we already have our utility effects covered.

Tear is a bit of a special snowflake in this regard. It's a component that can make Shojin and Blue Buff (good for casters, AD/AP agnostic), Hand of Justice (bruiser item, AD/AP agnostic), Archangels (AP), Void Staff (AP utility), Adaptive Helm (Frontline/Backline hybrid item), **and also** 2 other purely frontline items (Protector's Vow + Spirit Visage). This means an excess of tears can almost always be resolved and is rarely deemed a "problematic" component, even if a carry doesn't exactly have a demand for tears.
### Step 3: "ok man yapyapyap but what do i actually slam"
I would consider the previous steps to fall under preparation for learning a line. They're steps you would ideally take before the game begins, but if you're comfortable with the process it's something you can do mid-game by looking at stats or a guide. The second part of the example, where we decided which item to slam from our 3 components, is something that should be done in the moment (please do not construct a pre-made flow chart of a trillion item combos). The process is the same: consider each craftable item, what component(s) are leftover, and what that leftover component could be turned into, with extra weight on what it creates when paired with problematic components. Sometimes the correct decision is to just greed and not slam anything, but more often than not, you are better off slamming something.
### Step 4: Understand Back-up Variations
Some comps also have variations that can use a different set of components. If you receive many copies of "problematic components" in stage 3, but aren't confident in executing a full pivot, you could opt for a different variation of your comp to mitigate, or even fully negate, the presence of the components if such a variation exists. Here's a possible variation for Volibear (this is a level 9 board; prob drop Shen on level 8):![[Pasted image 20250819214521.png]]
Notice how with the introduction of Ashe over Samira, we have a way to use rods and bows (could play double Rageblade if too many rods). Sometimes, balance patches may cause a comp to fall into obscurity, while other times it only shifts which variation of the comp you prioritize. In this example, if the power gained from activating 4 Edgelord was heavily nerfed, there would no longer be a benefit to activating the trait to that depth. Similarly, if Ashe as a unit received a large buff and was able to overtake the power that 4 Edgelord currently provides, this variation could potentially become the new primary way to play the comp. 

*Funny enough, with the D-patch dropping and nerfing Volibear's ridiculous early-fight damage, the value of speccing deep into Edgelord has fallen and other variations such as this one are now probably more favored LOL but again this is just to give you an idea of how to analyze item econ.* 
## Conclusion
By combining the two key concepts of Item Economy with [[Item Distribution]] and [[Line Selection]], you can make informed decisions on what items to take on the carousel or if you need to select an item augment based on the state of your item economy. It can even inform decisions on what item slams to make in the moment, due to understanding which components are more likely to be dropped later in the game.

Having a thorough understanding of item economy, in particular to the comp that you are playing, gives you the confidence to make item slams early, because you know the leftover components will resolve nicely. Doing so helps you to save HP and enables you to play for winstreaks in the early and midgame instead of waiting until stage 5 (after receiving all components) to craft your items.
