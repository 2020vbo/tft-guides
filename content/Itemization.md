Itemization refers to the general theory behind what items to give to which units. [[Item Economy]] is one concept under this umbrella and probably the most complex, since it is interested in how to resolve variance rather than looking at things in a purely theoretical perspective. In addition to maximizing the value of each component through item economy, we can use other principles to determine what items are truly ideal and how we can best distribute our items across our units.


## Analyzing Carry Itemization
Now, the most obvious thing to consider with a carry is the AP/AD distinction. Outside of select 5-cost carries, a carry is always pretty much strictly AD or AP, and slamming Deathblade on an AP carry is not very conducive to winning. This is all straightforward enough—I'm sure you could have figured that out on your own, but what are some other factors we should take into account when evaluating how a carry wants to be itemized?

### Abilities/Casts
The most important thing you should be looking at when evaluating a carry is their ability and how it contributes to their damage output. Let's compare the 3 ranged AD 4-cost carries:
