Perhaps one of the most critical skills in TFT, Line Selection is a fairly self-explanatory term: it refers to the ability to determine what lines or comp(s) to be angling from as early as possible. Narrowing down what you're likely to play allows you to make slams more confidently and reduces your mental stack since you more or less know what units you want to hold on to. It also enables you to select more specialized augments over augments that provide generic buffs. In order to inform your early and midgame decisions as much as possible, it's generally ideal to have a line in mind on 2-1 while still leaving some room for flexibility in case of unfavorable variance.

There are 3 main factors when considering line selection:
1) Units from stage 1, either through orbs or from your shop
	- Pay special attention to upgraded units and 3 cost units
	- Using units you already have saves you gold that you'd normally have to spend rolling
	- You can also use these units to see if you have a winstreak angle
2) Item components received
	- Items more or less determine what carries you are allowed to play (have fun trying to force Ashe without a single bow)
3) Balance/Meta
	- The line you choose should at least be decentâ€”the whole point of line selection is to avoid shooting yourself in the foot
	- This also influences the units you prioritize holding (e.g. don't sell Lucian pair if you happen to know that Lucian is really strong on a given patch)

Here are other factors that may affect your decision making:
1) Gold
	- This won't lead you to a specific comp, but you can decide to play for 5 loss if you sell unit drops for gold
	- If you notice you're really poor in stage 2, you might not have enough gold to reach level 8 and roll on time
2) Consumable Drops
	- If you receive a small duplicator, you might be a bit more inclined to angle a reroll comp
	- Similarly, you may want to opt for a standard level 8 comp if you receive a regular duplicator, as a single duplicator greatly increases your consistency to reach a 2-star carry and tank.

These should play a much smaller role in your line selection but are worth thinking about. Sometimes, you'll end up using the small dupes in stage 3 for tempo to keep a win streak, and other times you might use a big dupe for the unit you're rerolling. Getting a small or large dupe shouldn't immediately lock you into playing reroll or standard.

Stage 2 also won't always go the way you planned. You may have to reevaluate your spot and adjust your gameplan accordingly before stage 3:
1) Units/Items/Gold
	- You'll have received more items from Krugs, and they may not be the items you wanted. You'll also have seen several shops by now or even received units as drops. Is it still reasonable to angle the original comp you wanted? Is your econ strong enough to play your desired comp?
2) HP
	- If you lost HP in stage 2, it's possible you'll want to save some HP in the midgame by rolling for a stronger board. This could inform your decision to play a reroll comp. 
	- See [[Economy - When to Spend Gold]] for more details.

Think critically about the conditions that must be met in order for your comp to succeed so that you don't stay committed to a line that don't meet the conditions of your gamestate.

That being said, there's one more thing to consider that's almost as important as everything else combined...

## MAKE SURE YOU AREN'T CONTESTED!!!!!!
You're not the only player making these decisions early in the game. Spend some time scouting in stage 2 to see what other people in the lobby are likely to play. You're not the only player that wants to commit early, so for most players, you have a very high chance of guessing what they want to play from their board in stage 2. For every player contesting you, the amount of gold needed to hit your units also increases, thereby also negatively impacting your average placement, so it's often worth playing a slightly worse comp if you're heavily contested.

Refer to [[Playing A Contested Line]] for more information on how to execute a game where you are contested.

## Narrowing Your Line
Since you can only receive one copy of each component on stage 1, and up to 5 components (usually 3), you usually won't be able to immediately commit to a single comp. Use your knowledge of [[Item Economy]] relative to your desired comps to determine what carries you could reasonably enable with the resources available to you. Instead, you may be able to narrow down your options to 2 or 3 comps and continue to narrow down your options based on your stage 2 shops and the components you receive on neutrals. Even your 3-2 augment can affect your line selection, but I'd say about 90-95% of games, you will be more or less committed by this point.

If you're playing a standard level 8 comp, there is still some room for flexibility on your 4-2 rolldown. Some frontlines can be effectively swapped out, or you can play a variation in your backline if you happen to hit many copies of a similar carry. While it may not be as strong, the gold it saves you is often worth it and could enable you to push to level 9 for 5-cost units. Playing a "sub-optimal" 2-star 4-cost is also usually better than the "ideal" 1-star 4-cost, but there have been cases of extremely bad balance (it has to be really insanely bad for this to happen tho).
